That was a game-changer for me. I moved on to Angular and Typescript, which were challenging but rewarding. I became a professional programmer and worked on projects using Ionic, Firebase, GCP, AWS, Docker, and Kubernetes. I learned a lot and had fun along the way.</p>}

The one who considers JavaScript (Typescript) as a fake language, and GoLang, C++, Rust as the real deal. And a real sucker for good music.</p>}
