# Where it all started

Well it started with a very aggressive approach more of a middle finger kind of approach towards education system. Where from the beginning years of my toddler age, I was asked to mug up the answers that were provided by the teachers. Even the teachers were like "Hey you have to learn it and write it in the exact same way, or else you won't get marks". So as I said i had a middle finger approach to the education, I never did learned any answers, and the teachers never gave me any good marks. This approach was naive but I still was able to good enough marks in most subject except Computer Science, 

## The arch nemesis

Somehow this method didn't worked for computer science and I remember this crystal clear, that because of this failed my 4th grade. And when the results were announced, I was somehow given "grace marks" a concept where you give the child additional marks so that if he has barely failed, like by 1 or 2 marks he/she/whatever pronoun can pass. So I passed but, the wrath fell upon me when my teacher shamed me in front of my parents. And as an Indian I got to some things done to me **crying noises** (I got beaten don't get any other ideas). 

## The term ended
My 4th class ended with the terrible results. And I got around a month for myself to enjoy. So I did what I liked the most. I played GTA Vice City, hourly, daily, weekly. And as usual I got smacked up again for this. One fine afternoon, I was playing GTA, alone, with lights turned off so that no one will no I am in the room. And then out of nowhere my elder brother saw me paying the game, and luckily without any complaining he also joined me. And he started playing, then he told a huge thing, that will change my life forever, he told me about how games are made. He told me that the trees and vehicles you see are all coded somewhere, people create these games. And write there my mind was blown and the target was set, I wanted to create GTA My City. Little did I know how much effort it can take to create game, so when I asked him how to create a game, he told me to learn HTML 

(now i know HTML ain't a game engine, but for someone like me who don't know shit about coding, HTML was a great start, at least I could move my name with marquee tag with alternate animation. I am pretty sure most React devs can't do that with JS, Ha! on your face fake web-devs)


## The coding renaissance 

This was the beginning of my coding journey. I started creating some HTML pages on my computer, and the very idea of whatever I type computer can do that in red color was amazing to me. I can choose whatever color I want from my color book. And that is saying something. I discovered my brother's school project that were made in HTML, I got to know about "a" tags, "video" tags, and a lot more. I amazed myself everyday, and also this year I got to introduced to internet as well, so I would search some websites that I want to see, and just right click > view page source > ctrl + c > ctrl + v Bammm Coderr. Haha. Genius. I am laughing and cringing now but at that moment seeing someone else's code from good website that didn't minify their code was the fastest way for me to learn. I got to know about w3 schools, and then CSS. But then the year ended and this time I was somehow able to not fail in my computer science class. HTML wasn't even a part of my course, but somehow I was able to remember everything, every answer, because computer's were becoming natural to me. 

## First programming language

I got introduced to my first actual programming language. And yes HTML ain't one.
So I got introduced to QBASIC. If you don't know what is it. Well it's a very simple interpreted language with super simple syntax. You should try it if you haven't yet. But that's when I got to know about, Loops, Conditions, Variables, GOTO. Yep that's it, nothing more. And then I created some prompt based games, like tic tac toe, puzzles, math puzzles, etc. It was fun and honestly this is the time when I would consider my-self as a coder. Not a good one, but a one. And as this was also the part of my CS course for my class I nailed it. Literally I got A+ in my CS. My teachers were shook, my parents were shook. It was amazing. I got the recognition of my life from that. Then I also took this a little bit seriously, and searched on YouTube "Best Programming Language" and I got to know, about python. Python, amazing language, but not a good one to start with. I would suggest someone to start with C but I got into YouTube bloat, so started with Python. I started learning Python it took me around 10 days to learn the basics of Python. Then I bought a book on Python, to learn it completely. And after spending around 4- 5 months creating random projects, I thought maybe I could create something like VsCode or PyCharm. I mean I like coding, but the IDE's doesn't feel home for me. I wanted more abstraction, like music in the IDE, Custom Snippets in the IDE, Multi-Explorer Windows, Multi window editor. And most of this stuff was missing from the code editor that I used which was Python IDE. So I set out a goal to create my own editor.

## Begins the journey of first project

The first tangible project I thought of creating was a code editor. I started looking for how to do it in python. And I choose the simplest library that I was able to work upon. Tkinter. It's not a good library for complex application such as "Text Editor" but fine, I was new to the language, and to the whole GUI thing. So I spent around 8 months on this project. And achieved something that to this day I think is literally impossible. The UI I created with Tkinter and Python was literally unrecognizable from the general UIs. It looked like a PyCharm Editor. Never thought that I will be able to create that. It worked like an editor I was able to edit files in it. Open projects in it, visualize my output in graph format. Play music in it, Multi Explorer window in it. When I used it for some actual project, I really got know how good it was. But one thing was pretty obvious, It was slow. Super slow, the syntax highlighting wasn't a tree-sitter based one it was a random loop based regex based highlighting. the scrolling felt sluggish when I opened a very huge file in it. But whatever the case maybe I really enjoyed making this. And creating something like this really improved my Python. I really got to know about how much effort, time, dedication and resources it takes to create a single project. Also got to know that the code that I was writing was pretty bad, and for a person who doesn't had any mentors, It was a pain in the ass to even judge the code. So started learning about design patterns in python and it had only been around 5-7 days, and something major happened.

## The journey of Web-Development

A major thing happened in my life, well, I was participating in a coding competition
